G'Day there Tuterino,

So I tried real hard to get this to work, but no matter what I change:
	A) It just doesn't seems to ever work.
	B) All my graphs grow out of control.
	C) They are all eventually unstable and throw themselves appart.

So in the hope of obtaining some part marks, I've attached an animation of what I've got so far. It's a little bit funky, but check it out anyway.

So I can get better results sometimes if I let KB = 1, and sometimes it works better if KB = 1.3E-23, but also the constant (a0 + b0) is a huge negative number, and means that if I use KB = 1, the graph grows by 1E5 every frame, and keeps flipping. I've checked my derivation against a bunch of friends, and they've got the same problems with the same equations. Check out how I evolve my function each frame beginning on line 154.

I really just generally have no idea what's going on. This worksheet was very complicated. I don't know what it's asking me to do.
