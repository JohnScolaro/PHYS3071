a = 1.042786 or 2.949444/(2^(3/2))
b = 0.5

So for the advanced task, I've done a variable transform to make the
integration limits finite. Without the constants, this is the origional
equation:

   2
  x
-------
      2
     x
1 + e

And we integrate this from 0 to V_{max}. If we apply the variable transform
y = (1/x) - 1, then we get this equation:

         2
  /1    \
  |- - 1|
  \y    /
------------
           2
    /1    \
    |- - 1|
 2  \y    /
y  e

Where we transform our integrand bounds to 1/(V_{max} + 1). This fixes the
bounds because where the previous integral was from 0 to infinity, now it is
from 0 to 1.

To get our integrals to demonstrate this assignment, the bounds which
previously were from:
0 to 1
0 to 2
0 to 3
Are now transformed to:
1/2 to 1
1/3 to 1
1/4 to 1.
These are the answers put into the output document.
